# Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) for Logging in a Spring Boot Application

This repository demonstrates how to implement logging in a Spring Boot application using Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP). The `LoggingAspect` aspect intercepts method calls within the application’s controllers, services, and DAOs, logging the execution details.

## Overview

Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a programming paradigm that provides a way to modularize cross-cutting concerns, such as logging, security, and transaction management, into aspects. This documentation explores how to implement AOP for logging in a Spring Boot application.

## Purpose of `LoggingAspect`

The `LoggingAspect` aspect is responsible for:
- Intercepting method calls within the application’s controller, service, and DAO layers.
- Logging the execution details, including:
  - Method names
  - Arguments passed to the methods
  - Return values
  - Any exceptions thrown

## Understanding the Components

### Pointcuts

- **`forControllerPackage()`**: Matches method executions in the `controller` package.
- **`forServicePackage()`**: Matches method executions in the `service` package.
- **`forDaoPackage()`**: Matches method executions in the `dao` package.
- **`forAppFlow()`**: Combines the above pointcuts using a logical OR (`||`) to create a broader pointcut that applies to the entire application flow.

### Before Advice

- **`before()`**: Runs before the target method is executed. It logs the method name and any arguments passed to it.

### AfterReturning Advice

- **`afterReturning()`**: Runs after the target method successfully returns. It logs the method name and the returned value.

### AfterThrowing Advice

- **`afterThrowing()`**: Runs if the target method throws an exception. It logs the method name and the exception details.
